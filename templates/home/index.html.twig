Create a news parsing service from a news resource, for example hightload.today. The service must have a page displaying the list of downloaded news and a CLI command to start parsing.
Parsing features:
-	from each article, the download should and be saved:
-	title
-	short description
-	picture
-	date added
-	when parsing, it is necessary to check the presence of the title in the database, and if the news is already in the database, make a note about the date and time of the last update
-	database queries should be optimized for heavy load
-	parsing should be in several parallel processes (via rabbitMQ)
-	parsing must be run via cron
Features of the page for viewing news from the database:
-	the page for viewing news from the database should be available only after authorization in the system (registration is not required)
-	Authorized users can be with one of two roles: admin or moderator (the administrator can delete articles)
-	there must be pagination at the end of the list of articles (10 per page)
Stack:
-	Symfony 5.4
-	Php 7.4
-	Mysql
-	Bootstrap 5.1
-	Docker (docker-compose)
-	RabbitMQ
